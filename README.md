# Dijkstra's Algorithm in C++

## 📌 Overview

This C++ program demonstrates **Dijkstra's Algorithm**, a fundamental method for finding the **shortest path** from a single source node to all other nodes in a weighted graph.

Steps Dijkstra follows:

1. Starts from a chosen source node.
2. Uses a **priority queue** to select the closest unvisited node.
3. Updates distances to all neighbors if a shorter path is found.
4. Repeats until all nodes are visited.

It prints the shortest distances from the source node to every other node in the graph.
